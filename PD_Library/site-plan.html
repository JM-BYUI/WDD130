You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3>[Books]</h3>
      <p>
        This website will have a basic template that can be replicated over and over again as new books are added. Maybe I’ll find a way to track which books get viewed the most and have a homepage where the most popular selections are shown. If I can’t get that working, then it’ll just be a list of recommended picks by me. The book overview pages will be fairly short and to the point. On the top it’ll have the book title, and then a sidebar to the right listing the author, publishing date, length, and genre. To the left of that will be an image of the book’s cover (which will also be royalty free/under fair use). Beneath that will be a short summary. And maybe beneath that, a space for users to comment and leave reviews. There could also be separate pages for authors if they have multiple books. Additionally, you could click on categories depending on genre as well.

      <h3>[Other Media]</h3>
      <p>
        Seeing as a variety of media falls under public domain, I could also add an option to search for music, audiobooks, and art. For audiobooks, I was thinking of having a dropdown to select which form of a book you would prefer, the text or audio version. This would definitely work towards making this site have a broader function and appeal, though it might be more trouble than it’s worth.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Legal Issues]</h3>
      <p>
        To do this, I’m going to have to familiarize myself with what exactly falls into the category of public domain media. This might include having to tag each page with a legal disclaimer or something like that. I’ll update this once I’ve done more research.

      <h3>[Audience & User Attraction]</h3>
      <p>
        This site is meant as a cohesive, easy to use source for public domain books, plays, poems, and other works. While you can probably find many of these by searching them on google, this site will act as a single hub for these works, in addition to displaying cover images and synopses of the works. The ease of access and clean interface provided will win over users who would otherwise have to meticulously search for what they want or use sites with outdated or clunky user interfaces. This site will appeal to college students who don’t want to buy books for their classes who can instead find their books free and legally online. This will not only save them money but can also be used instead of sketchier/less reliable alternatives. To reach a wider audience, I might want to look into an easy to understand, short, and simple name. Something catchy and easy to search.
